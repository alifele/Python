# How to Use The PyGame Template


I wrote a template, which by using it, you will be able to use the pygame in a p5.js like format.


To use this template in your project, you need to wirte your code in the sketch.py (note that the name of this file must not be changed. Because it has been imported in the main.py file)


after writing your code, now, you should run the main.py script.
