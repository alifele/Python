# Smart Rockets With Genetic Algorithms




This code illustrates some *blind* rockets that initally have **NO** information about the position of the target.

their path gets better and better as more of them discovers how to get to the red target at the top of the picture.



you can see the result of code in three stages:

### first runs:

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifele/Python/master/PyGame/Genetic%20algorithm/rockets/rockets0.png  "inital")

### after a while:

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifele/Python/master/PyGame/Genetic%20algorithm/rockets/rockets1.png  "after a while")

### at the end:
![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alifele/Python/master/PyGame/Genetic%20algorithm/rockets/rockets3.png  "finally")

***
to run this code on your own mchine you will need:

* python 3.7
* numpy
* pygame
* matplotlib
