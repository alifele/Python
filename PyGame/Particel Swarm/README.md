#Particle Swarm Algorithm

This is an example of the particle swarm algorithm. I have used python, numpy, matplotlib and pygame as the dependencies.


#How it works:
This code is actually consists of two main scripts.
One script generates a landscape (that the particles are trying to find its minimum) and will save it as land.png.
The other script will read this image and will apply the algorithm in it.

you can see the output of the algorithm in the two following images:

dependencies:
